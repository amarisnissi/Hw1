1.  The bell-shaped Gaussian probability density function,

      f(x)=12π−−√σexp[−12(x−μσ)2]
      f(x)=12πσexp⁡[−12(x−μσ)2]

is one of the most widely used functions in science and technology. The parameters of the function (μ∈[−∞,+∞]μ∈[−∞,+∞], σ>0σ>0) are prescribed real numbers. Write a MATLAB script for evaluating this function when μ=0μ=0, σ=2σ=2, x=1x=1. Verify your answer by getting the same result from Wolfram Alpha mathematical search engine, also by using MATLAB’s builtin function normpdf(xx,μμ,σσ).
