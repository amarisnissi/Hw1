# Homework-2
## 1. Type the following in the command window and submit the results. Briefly explain what each assignment does.

>> a = 1                  This sets a as the variable for 1.

>> b = 'x'                This sets b to be a variable for 'x'.

>> c = true               This sets 'c' to convert numerical values to logicals. Any nonzero element of A is converted to logical 1 (true) and zeros are converted to logical 0 (false). Complex values and NaNs cannot be converted to logical values and result in a conversion error.

>> whos a b c             This command allows us to distinguish the size, class, and bytes of the variables.

>> a == c                 This command told us that the variables a and c equaled each other.

>> a + c                  This command told us to add the variables together.

>> d = [1 2 3 4]          This command gave us an array of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.

>> e = ['a' 'b' 'c' 'd']  This command set an array of a, b, c, d.

>> f = ['abcd']           This command set an array of a, b, c, d.

>> g = {‘a’ ‘b’ ‘c’ ‘d’}  This command created a 1x4 Cell Array for the inputs of the variables a, b, c, d.

>> h = { a b c d}         This command created a 1x4 Cell Array for the outputs of the previous variables.

>> whos d e f g h         This command allows us to view the variables' attributes such as size, bytes, and class.

## 2. What would happen if you go beyond the range for a particular type? For example, the largest integer that can be stored in int8 is 127, and the smallest integer is -128, so what would happen if we type cast a larger integer to the type int8? Smaller integer? Use the built-in functions intwine and intmax to find the largest and smallest integers that can be stored in int16 and int32.

For int16:

>> intmin('int16')

ans =

  int16
  
   -32768
   
>> intmax('int16')

ans =

  int16
  
   32767
   
For int32:

>> intmin('int32')

ans =

  int32
  
   -2147483648
   
>> intmax('int32')

ans =

  int32
  
   2147483647
